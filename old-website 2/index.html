                <p>
                    Pygmy is an operating system originally intended for the MSP430 series. It has sinceoutgrown
                    the MSP430 and is now primarilly intended for ARM, specifically STM32 and other
                    similar CortexM3 core MCUs. It is quick, flexible and user friendly. Pygmy is built
                    from the ground up with MCU friendly code.

                Why PygmyOs?</div>
            <div class="contentText">
                <p>
                    PygmyOs was designed as a professional grade operating system with the hobbiest
                    in mind. This opens up PygmyOs to corporations as well as individuals.

                <p>
                    The first PygmyWEB prototypes have been assembled and tested.<br />
                    Testing on the mesh networking code is in progress. Other code that needs to be
                    completed is the memory allocation functions to take advantage of the external SRAM.
                    First release of basic libraries and bootloader coming soon.
