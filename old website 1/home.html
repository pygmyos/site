    Progress report! The first PygmyWEB prototypes have been assembled and tested!
    Tested functions include:
        JTAG
        USB
        Bootloader
        2.4GHz RF
        8MB FLASH
        32KB SRAM
        Boost Converter ( charge, run from solar cell )
        LiPO charger

        I will begin the mesh networking code in ernest now. Other code that needs to
    be completed is the memory allocation functions to take advantage of the external
    SRAM. First release of basic libraries and bootloader coming soon.

What is Pygmy?
    The condensed version is: Pymgy is an Operating System for MCUs.
    
Why another Operating System?
    The answer is apparent if you simply look at the options.

    Pygmy was originally intended for the MSP430 series. It has since outgrown
the MSP430 and is now primarilly intended for ARM, specifically STM32 and other
similar CortexM3 core MCUs. It is quick, flexible and user friendly. 
    Pygmy is built from the ground up with MCU friendly code, including the
following:

    Bootloader:
        The Pygmy Bootloader provides a simple yet powerful interface to accomplish
        a variety of goals. It has an integrated X-Modem driver, a PygmyFAT file
        system interface ( list files, rename, remove, receive, send ), re-flashing,
        as well as a simple memory debugging interface( peek and poke with memory
        dump ).
    PygmyFAT and FAT12/FAT16: 
        PygmyFAT is ideally suited to embedded FLASH memory.
        Unlike FAT12/FAT16, it's specificaly designed to minimize repeated write
        cycles to any given location in memory, helping increase reliabilty.
    PygmyResource: 
        A multimedia resource file format that supports audio, video,
        images, fonts and image strips. 
    String Manipulation: 
        Pygmy includes a library with such functionality as 
        Base64 and hex encoded translation functions. 
    Commandline Framework: 
        Pygmy includes a command line framework, making it a
        breeze to interface via scripting or IO streams. 
    Video Interface: 
        Pygmy includes a graphics interface framework, all high level
        code is separated, only a board-level patch needs to be provided. 
    PFTP: 
        FTP over HTTP for a small footprint file transfer method on web enabled
        devices. PFTP is highly tolerant of degraded connections.
    PDIA: 
        Pygmy Data Integrity Algorithm provides a seamless way to generate high
        strength sums on data streams to protect data transfers from corruption.
    Multithreading: 
        Load up the threads! Tasks are driven my millisec timer and have fully
        configurable use of resources, time slots, max tasks, etc.
    Messaging:
        Inter-process communications system that is easy to use and thread safe
    Clock:
        Real Time Clock with calender functions as well as a millisec timer for
        threads and general timing.
